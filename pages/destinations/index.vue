        <p>What we need for this page:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The masthead should be a map with coffee shops, similar to the one on Fat Hippo, use free maps such as OpenMaps, Leaflet.</li>
          <li>A grid of destinations with thumbnail images showing the coffee shop front or interior.</li>
          <li>Maybe a simple text search to filter the reviews.</li>
          <li>A box that encourages coffee shop owners to get listed (future addition).</li>
          <li>A call to action strip.</li>
          <li>A newsletter signup strip (future addition).</li>
        </ul>
