          <p><strong>How it works?</strong></p>
          <p>Coffee brewers</p>
          <p>We often visit and occassionally write a comprehensive review about a coffee shop. When we publish a review, the coffee shop will automatically get listed on our website for free (althogh we would appreciate your paid membership). However, if you're a coffee shop owner and would like one of us to visit you and leave a review, you can get listed for just £1 per month. We won't let you know when someone will visit you. The whole premise of this platform is to make our work secret, so that you will never know when one of us is enjoying a coffee in your coffee shop and writing a review. You can get notified when review is added.</p>
          <p><strong>Coffee detectives</strong></p>
          <p>Anyone can become a coffee detective. We value inclusiveness and would love to read about experiences from a wide range of coffee lovers. To become a coffee detective, you will need to create a membership account for just £1 per month. This will give you the access to tools and guidance on all you need to know to become a coffee detective. The fun part is that you can visit any coffee shop, whenever you like, and write a review in a secret, so that no one know that you are one of us. However, all reviews must meet our rules and guidelines. You can read more about them on our terms and conditions pages.</p>
