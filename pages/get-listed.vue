        <h2 class="feature__title">Why to get listed?</h2>
        <p class="feature__text">Our coffee detectives visit coffee shops in Tyne and Wear everyday. However, we cannot guarantee that one of them will visit you becuase it's entirely up to them to choose where to go and when to write a review.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="page-content">
        <p>Therefore, we offer an option to get your coffee shop, stall, truck, bike and anything in between listed on our platform from just Â£3.00 per month (T&C apply). By doing so, you can rest assured that at least one of our detectives will visit you and write a review. However, we cannot tell you when they will visit you and who it's going to be. The entire premise of this platform is to keep our detectives anonymous. That's the whole fun!</p>
        <p>If your cafe is already listed on platform, you can claim it. By claiming your cafe, you receive the full access to manage your listing on our platform. That enables you to set your own price range, opening times, coffee blend, food and cuisine served, dietary requirements, and amenities. Although our coffee detectives work hard to keep all cafes listed on our platform up-to-date, claiming your cafe and managing it yourself is the best way to keep your listing fresh.</p>
