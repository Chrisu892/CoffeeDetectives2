        <h2 class="feature__title">Why to get listed?</h2>
        <p class="feature__text">Our coffee detectives visit coffee shops in the North East everyday. However, we cannot guarantee that one of them will visit you becuase it's entirely up to them to choose where to go and when to write a review.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="page-content">
        <p>Therefore, we offer an option to get your coffee shop, stall, truck, bike and anything in between listed on our platform from just £1.00 per month (T&C apply). By doing so, you can rest assured that at least one of our detectives will visit you and write a review. However, we cannot tell you when they will visit you and who it's going to be. The entire premise of this platform is to keep our detectives anonymous. That's the whole fun!</p>
