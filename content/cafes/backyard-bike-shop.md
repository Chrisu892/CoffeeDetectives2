  directions: 'You can find the Backyard Bike Shop on Gateshead Quaside, tucked under the iconic Tyne Bridge. You need to enter the area through the gate next to the Swing Bridge and walk down onto Hillgate Quay that runs alongside the river. On your right will be shipping containers. The Backyard Bike Shop is located in the next container just under the bridge. There is a small terrace in front of the cafe.'
