  description: "Although not a cafe per se, Luther's Bar offers a cozy atmosphere for those who want to socialise, read a book or study. The place is tucked away right behind Newcastle University Students' Union building. Although Luther's serves Sturbucks coffee, we believe this place is worth being on this list for it's atmosphere, friendly staff, and sitting area. There is also a piano for those who would like to try piano for the first time, or if you're a pianist, you could entertain the guests with nice Jazzy tunes."
  directions: "Luther's Bar is located on the Floor 0 of Newcastle University Students' Union building."
